00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,240
>> So we just talked a bit about how

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,055
to create virtual environments
and why they're important,

3
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:07,245
Let's take a look at that
in some actual code,

4
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:09,765
So I have here a Jupyter Notebook,

5
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:11,730
One of the things we
often do in working with

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,295
Python is to import different
libraries; Pandas, NumPy,

7
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:17,085
You'll see some of these as
we go through this course,

8
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:18,660
Now, in this case,

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,555
I have one where I'm importing
something from matplotlib,

10
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:24,375
This is another library we're
going to play around with later,

11
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:27,675
When I run this line of code
and try to import the library,

12
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:29,340
I get an error message saying,

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,115
"Cannot find the module matplotlib,"

14
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:35,430
This is probably the number
1 error message you're

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,960
going to get used to seeing when

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,630
you're working inside
Jupyter Notebooks,

17
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,840
So we want to learn how do we

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,860
deal with that message
when it comes up,

19
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,400
When we did the intro to Python
course with Christopher,

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,840
we learned how to work
with virtual environments,

21
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,920
But with Jupyter Notebooks,

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,140
we usually do this with
something called conda,

23
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,320
So if I close this
down, you can see here,

24
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,195
this was actually the conda
environment I was using,

25
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:56,530
but we aren't going to be using

26
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,405
that one because it was
giving us an error message,

27
00:00:58,405 --> 00:01:01,629
So if we have launched
the Anaconda Prompt,

28
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:04,390
you can see right now I'm
in the base environment,

29
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,415
because of the word
base appearing here,

30
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:07,870
So what I'm going to need to do,

31
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,105
is create a new virtual environment,

32
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:13,105
So I could tell conda, I want
to create a new environment,

33
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:19,580
and I'm going to give it the
name Python environment,

34
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,640
It's going to be a Python
environment with Python version 3,7,

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,930
I'm just putting a dash y here,

36
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,160
so if any prompts come
up asking me questions,

37
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,260
it will simply automatically

38
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,590
answer yes to those
types of questions,

39
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,760
Now, it's going off and creating

40
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,925
this virtual environment
for me, for conda,

41
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:39,815
Once I've created that environment,

42
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:44,020
I can then move to that environment
by saying, "Conda activate,"

43
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,560
It's even nice, it
gives me a little hint

44
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,240
here in case I forget the commands,

45
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,330
Activate my environment,
which I called PythonEnv,

46
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,510
Remember, this is just the name
I gave to the environment,

47
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,820
Once you've activated
that environment,

48
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,859
you'll even notice that the prompt

49
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:00,470
will actually show you
the environment name,

50
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,065
So you can remember that you're
in your virtual environment,

51
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:05,090
Now, I can install any of

52
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,150
the libraries I might need to
use when I'm writing my code,

53
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:12,440
So in our case, we are getting
an error, trying matplotlib,

54
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,420
So we can say, "Hey, conda,

55
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,650
would you please install
matplotlib for me?"

56
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,275
So now, it's going to
install that library,

57
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:24,450
So but I'll be able to access
it from inside of my code,

58
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,880
Now, once we've installed
the matplotlib library,

59
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,320
you might have other
libraries you'll need to

60
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,315
install as well depending on
what you're trying to do,

61
00:02:32,315 --> 00:02:34,040
But there's one extra library you

62
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,140
always want to install and that one,

63
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,610
so maybe you install Pandas,

64
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,220
maybe install NumPy, but
we definitely want to

65
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,175
install one called, Jupyter,

66
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:45,020
So we actually want
to install Jupyter,

67
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,805
which is what runs the Notebooks
inside our virtual environment,

68
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:51,710
Because that way when we
run the Jupyter Notebooks,

69
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,380
we know the Jupyter
installation is actually

70
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,180
using the libraries that we have

71
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,040
installed inside this
virtual environment,

72
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,440
Once the Notebooks
had been installed,

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,850
then we'll actually going to launch

74
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,925
Jupyter Notebooks from the
actual Anaconda Prompt itself,

75
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:11,320
So this time when I say
run Jupyter Notebook,

76
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,859
I'm launching Jupyter
Notebooks from inside

77
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:17,430
my conda environment, PythonEnv,

78
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,255
This time when we navigate to

79
00:03:20,255 --> 00:03:21,860
our Notebook and we go to

80
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,305
that line of code where it
couldn't find matplotlib,

81
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,965
we're going to see that line of
code is going to run successfully,

82
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:28,940
So you get a little peek
behind the scenes here

83
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,845
at all the various notebooks,

84
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:32,825
Susan has created for this course,

85
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:36,710
But if I go back to the one where
we had imported matplotlib,

86
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,240
you'll see here before we
was giving us an error,

87
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,180
But now when we run that line
of code, it runs successfully,

88
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,655
So no more errors,

89
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:46,490
So now, when you're using

90
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,980
a Jupyter Notebook and you get
that error message saying,

91
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,630
"Hey, I can't find that library,"

92
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,565
You know how to create
a conda environment,

93
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,110
install your libraries there,

94
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,520
run your Jupyter Notebook,

95
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,690
and get it going successfully,
