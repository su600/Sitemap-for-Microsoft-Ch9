00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,155
>> Before we get into this module,

2
00:00:04,155 --> 00:00:09,210
I want to make sure that I'm
setting expectations appropriately,

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,595
We are not going to get
into selecting which model,

4
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:18,060
differences between the model, etc,

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,040
There's a lot to that,

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,020
We actually do have content
that you can go check out,

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,865
that will give you more
information about that,

8
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:29,390
I've mentioned to a handful of times

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,640
already, the GitHub repository,

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,260
Again, if you go there,

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,150
you're going to notice
that we have links to

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,190
additional resources where you can

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,390
start to dig deeper into
those types of conversations,

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,640
Like, hey, what's the
difference between

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,490
logical regression and
linear regression?

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,375
So you can go check all of that out,

17
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:53,540
The example that I want to walk

18
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,645
through here is going to
use linear regression,

19
00:00:56,645 --> 00:01:00,110
which is designed to predict

20
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,720
a value and potentially show

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,630
all of us that on a
neat little chart,

22
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,165
That's what linear
regression is all about,

23
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:13,790
Again, well, what you want to
be able to do is to predict how

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,750
late or how early a particular
flight is going to be,

25
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,895
That's exactly what linear
regression can do for us,

26
00:01:22,895 --> 00:01:26,375
Again, if you want a deeper
conversation on all of that,

27
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:29,000
you can check out the links
inside the repository

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,785
and learn more about all
the possibilities there,

29
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:38,300
Let's go ahead and take a look at
how we're going to take all of

30
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,755
our prepared data and start
to feed that into a model,

31
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:45,640
So if you remember from before,
this is what we've got,

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,895
We've got our training data,

33
00:01:46,895 --> 00:01:48,245
We've got our testing data,

34
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:49,370
We've got our features,

35
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,710
We've got our labels,

36
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,355
We're ready to go,

37
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:55,750
We're all dressed up, now
we just need a destination,

38
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,395
You need to have somewhere to go,

39
00:01:57,395 --> 00:01:59,825
That somewhere that
we're going to go,

40
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:04,580
is going to be into
some form of a model,

41
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,515
into some form of an algorithm,

42
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:08,630
and in this particular case,

43
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,765
it's going to be linear regression,

44
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:14,690
So linear regression is going
to give us that ability

45
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,990
to predict a value there,

46
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,280
that's going to be
some form of a line,

47
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,860
thus the name linear regression,

48
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,695
See, it's not just a clever name,

49
00:02:26,695 --> 00:02:29,720
Now there's a little fit function or

50
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,790
a little fit method
that we're going to

51
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,130
use after we get a
bit all of our data,

52
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,920
that's going to actually give

53
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,770
us the ability in turn
to start to predict

54
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:46,060
values and give us outcomes for
any new data that we fill into it,

55
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,840
As I mentioned at the outset,

56
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,800
there's a lot of different
ways that we can do this,

57
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,875
There's a lot of different classes
that are available to us and

58
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,540
we can use Scikit-learn and there's

59
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,480
other utilities out there that
you might want to check out,

60
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,490
We're going to use Scikit-learn
to perform this operation,

61
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,210
So it typically is going to
follow the same pattern here,

62
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,220
where we're going to import

63
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,550
in the desired class that's
going to do our work,

64
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,260
We're going to create
an instance of that,

65
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,620
and then we're going
to call fit to have

66
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,420
it start doing all of its work,

67
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,455
Now, that's what I'm
about to demo here,

68
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,260
But as you might expect,

69
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,090
there's still more to it,

70
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,540
So when I go in and
I run all of this,

71
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,890
the next question becomes,

72
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,695
well, how accurate is that?

73
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:38,280
That's what we're going
to see in a later module,

74
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,440
For right now, what I want to
focus in on is the mechanic,

75
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,190
How do we now take our data
and fit that into a model?

76
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,720
That's going to be our core demo
