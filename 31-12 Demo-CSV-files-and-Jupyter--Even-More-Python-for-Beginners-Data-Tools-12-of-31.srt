00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,930
>> So I have a nice
CSV file here and I

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,095
want to be able to use this and
accesses with my Python code,

3
00:00:07,095 --> 00:00:08,280
but how do I get to it?

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,160
So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go to Jupyter,

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,830
and I'm going to create
a folder so that I

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,485
can keep all the data
files in one place,

7
00:00:16,485 --> 00:00:19,095
So over here on the right-hand
side, I can just say,

8
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:22,150
give me a new folder
instead of a new notebook,

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,275
By default, you'll see it
shows up as untitled folder,

10
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,830
So all I have to do is
simply select that and

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,555
then there's a rename option
to give it a better name,

12
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:32,025
So I'm going to call that data,

13
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:33,890
That's a fairly common name given

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,170
to folders where we
restore data files,

15
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,795
Then once I have the folder created,

16
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:41,840
I simply select that folder and

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,260
then I can upload whatever
CSV files I want to use,

18
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,810
So I have this CSV file

19
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,555
with information about all
sorts of different airports,

20
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:54,070
and I ask it to upload that file,

21
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,750
Once it's uploaded, you
can even see that you have

22
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,630
successfully uploaded your
CSV file into Jupyter,

23
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,030
So now our Python code inside

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,460
the Jupyter Notebook is going
to be able to access this file,
