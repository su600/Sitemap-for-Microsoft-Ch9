00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,610
>> There's an old
coworker of mine who is,

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,485
I'm assuming still to this day,

3
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:09,030
really fond of saying,

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,950
we're not launching rockets here,

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,590
and that phrase has stuck
with me for my entire career,

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,970
The point that he was trying to

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,350
make when he would say that phrase,

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,925
"We're not launching rockets here,"

9
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:22,995
is that whatever it
is that we're doing,

10
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:28,005
it's really not necessarily
all that complex,

11
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:31,035
We're not necessarily
breaking new ground,

12
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:32,924
we're not launching rockets,

13
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:34,904
and as a result,

14
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:36,805
whatever it is that we're doing,

15
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:39,920
whatever problems it is
that we're trying to solve,

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,520
chances are somebody else
has already been there and

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,635
they've already built
some form of a solution,

18
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:50,300
One great example of
that is when you're

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,645
dealing with a CRUD web application,

20
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:55,580
CRUD of course, stemming for Create,

21
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,615
Retrieve, Update, and Delete,

22
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:04,055
This is really a line of business
application where I've got data,

23
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:06,080
I want to be able to manipulate it,

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,760
I want to be able to search
for different items,

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,050
I want to be able to filter and
like do all of those basic things,

26
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,350
I want to create records,
I want to get them back,

27
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,805
I want to be able to update them,

28
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:18,805
I want to be able to delete them,

29
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:23,780
Basically, every Web
Developer at some point

30
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,460
has created some form of

31
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,550
an application that's going
to be a CRUD application,

32
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,045
Again, create, retrieve,
update, delete,

33
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:33,800
So rather than every time

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,500
we need to create one of
those types of applications,

35
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,850
go off and start setting up
all of the code on our own,

36
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,005
Start setting up all of
the codes to do paging,

37
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:45,735
which is a real challenge,

38
00:01:45,735 --> 00:01:50,149
Let's instead use code that
somebody else has already created,

39
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:53,590
and one framework that
has done exactly that,

40
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,370
and a framework that I'm a huge fan

41
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,225
of is this little
thing called Django,

42
00:01:58,225 --> 00:02:03,665
Django is going to help
make its magic happen,

43
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:07,190
Help allow me to integrate
with it by using

44
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,630
this little thing called
multiple inheritance or mixins,

45
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,330
I bet you're wondering when I
was finally going to get to

46
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,970
the text that was
behind me, Here we are,

47
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,100
So what I'm really trying to do

48
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,800
here is I'm trying
to set the stage for

49
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,440
when and why it is that you

50
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,330
might decide to use
something like this,

51
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,960
and quite frequently it's
because we want to be

52
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,920
able to clip into a framework,

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,500
Well, let's define some
terms to start with,

54
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,840
Let's go ahead and talk a little
bit about multiple inheritance,

55
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,215
Multiple inheritance
as the name implies,

56
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:49,090
means that I'm able to inherit
from multiple classes,

57
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,920
Now, you're also going to notice that

58
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,735
some people will call this mixins

59
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:56,585
for reasons that we'll start
to see a little bit later,

60
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:58,840
Now, one thing to note about

61
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,520
multiple inheritance is that it's
actually a little controversial,

62
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,655
You're going to notice that a
lot of programming languages,

63
00:03:06,655 --> 00:03:11,330
Java, C-Sharp, don't support
multiple inheritance,

64
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,250
Yes, they'll allow you to
implement multiple interfaces,

65
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,870
It's a different
conversation altogether,

66
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,415
but they only allow you to
inherit from one class,

67
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:23,780
and the reason that they've made

68
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,395
that decision is because
well, quite frankly,

69
00:03:27,395 --> 00:03:31,550
multiple inheritance can
get messy really quick,

70
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,300
that a lot of Developers
don't necessarily use it real

71
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,710
well because it can get complicated,

72
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,570
So why have it then?

73
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,220
Where might we use this?

74
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,825
Well, it's useful in those
exact types of scenarios

75
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:49,670
where what I'm looking to

76
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,250
do is to either take
advantage of a framework,

77
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,455
Again, I mentioned
Django at the outset,

78
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:57,485
or I'm trying to streamline

79
00:03:57,485 --> 00:04:02,180
repetitious operations
or repetitive operations

80
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:10,520
that I'm trying to do the same
thing over and over again,

81
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,400
you just see where that's
going with that joke,

82
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,265
All right, So let's highlight
then this scenario,

83
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:21,845
So here's what I want
to be able to create,

84
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,355
I want to create my own
framework where I'm

85
00:04:25,355 --> 00:04:29,335
going to give you the ability
to connect to a database,

86
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,640
All that you need to do is give me

87
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,835
the name of the database
that you want to connect to,

88
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:40,790
In addition, I also want to
give you the ability to quickly

89
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,390
log out to the screen

90
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,200
or to a file system behind
the scenes or wherever it is,

91
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,140
But I don't want you to
worry about any of that,

92
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,715
I don't want you to have to worry

93
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:54,950
about how to write out to a file,

94
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,160
Or maybe we've decided

95
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,330
to update things that are we're going

96
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,560
to write out to the event log,

97
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,290
I don't want you to worry about that,

98
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,240
I want to give you the ability

99
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,030
instead to focus in on the code that

100
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:13,370
you're creating and not worry
about the nitty-gritty,

101
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,380
I don't want you to worry about

102
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,180
the exact machinations of

103
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,980
how we're going to connect
out to the database,

104
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,405
You just tell me where to connect,

105
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:22,070
we'll take care of the rest for you,

106
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,505
I don't want you to worry about
how we're going to do logging,

107
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:27,650
Just tell me what it is
that you want to log,

108
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,255
I'll take care of the rest for you,

109
00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:32,810
and this is where
something like mixins

110
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,390
or multiple inheritance
can really shine,

111
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,970
Because now I can take
advantage of each one of

112
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,180
these depending on what
it is that I'm doing,

113
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,480
So maybe I've got some
operation over here where all

114
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,855
that I want to be able to do is
just write out to the logfile,

115
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:49,420
No database required,

116
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,830
Maybe I've got something
going on where I want

117
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,170
to be able to write
out to a database,

118
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,925
but no logging is required,

119
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:59,180
This is where mixins come into play,

120
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,720
So let's break all of this
down with our code here,

121
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,340
So you're going to notice that I'm

122
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,185
going to create two classes here,

123
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:07,925
One that's called Loggable

124
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:10,420
and the other one that's
called Connection,

125
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,310
With loggable, what I'm going to look

126
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,835
for is I'm going to look for,

127
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,800
in this case, a title,

128
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,580
and then I'm going to
go ahead and login,

129
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,790
So because of course,

130
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,170
I'm trying to keep things a
little bit straight forward,

131
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,130
I'm going to just go ahead and
print it out to the screen,

132
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:35,030
So I will print out whatever it
is that's inside of the title,

133
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,910
The other thing that I want
you to notice is that I'm

134
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,330
going to set up a connection here,

135
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,260
and again, just to try and simulate

136
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,585
how it is that we're connecting out,

137
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:46,185
I'm just going to print out, "Hey,

138
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:48,200
we're connecting out to
whatever the name of the server

139
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,795
is," and then right here,

140
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:56,475
I'm going to go ahead and
store the name of the server,

141
00:06:56,475 --> 00:07:01,150
So there's our loggable and
there is our connection,

142
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,565
Now, the next question
then becomes, well,

143
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:06,410
if I'm going to keep
building this framework,

144
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,190
how am I going to put this to action?

145
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,690
Here's my really fancy framework,

146
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,050
So what my framework is
going to do is it's going

147
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,745
to take whatever item it
is that you give to it,

148
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:20,720
and then I'm going to look to say,

149
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,380
hey, did you inherit from connection?

150
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,900
That's what his instance
is going to tell me,

151
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,915
and if you did now I know
that I can call connect,

152
00:07:31,915 --> 00:07:34,535
Then I'm going to go
ahead and check to see,

153
00:07:34,535 --> 00:07:36,065
did you inherit from loggable?

154
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:38,345
That's what his instance
again is going to do for me,

155
00:07:38,345 --> 00:07:42,155
and if you did, then I can
go ahead and call log,

156
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:44,615
It's such a wonderful toy,

157
00:07:44,615 --> 00:07:48,415
little obscure reference for
my own entertainment there,

158
00:07:48,415 --> 00:07:52,860
Now, I can go ahead and
create a class here,

159
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,710
So I'm going to create
a database class,

160
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,470
and my database class is
going to inherit from

161
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,610
Connection and it's going
to inherit from Loggable,

162
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,050
and now all I need to do to

163
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,720
enable the appropriate
functionality is go

164
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,020
ahead and set up those two
little properties right there,

165
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:16,770
and then if I wanted to do anything
else inside of this class,

166
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:26,110
I'm absolutely able to do that,

167
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:32,720
The key thing here is the fact
that if I want to enable logging,

168
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,730
I just simply inherit from

169
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,185
Loggable and then set up
whatever my title is,

170
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:42,020
If I want to enable
connecting to a database,

171
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,440
I simply inherit from
connection and then set up

172
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,950
whatever it is that I need to
set up, and then later on,

173
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,480
if I decide I'm going
to create something

174
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,465
else that's not going to be loggable,

175
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,325
well, then just don't
inherit from loggable,

176
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:58,790
That's really it, So now,

177
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,520
I create an instance of that class,

178
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,699
I call my super-duper
high-end framework,

179
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:07,130
and eventually what we would

180
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,340
notice is the printout on
the screen that it's going

181
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:15,829
to connect to the database and
it's going to log our message,

182
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:18,500
Now, I'm going to get to the
code in just a moment here,

183
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,810
but I want to close by saying this,

184
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,925
The vast majority of the time

185
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:24,950
that you're going to use
multiple inheritance

186
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:30,160
or mixins is a when you're
using an existing framework,

187
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,190
There's this great little
thing called the code smell,

188
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,460
where it's really trying

189
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,490
to indicate the fact that
something might not be right,

190
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,015
Something just smells wrong,
something smells unpleasant,

191
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:50,320
and multiple inheritance can
quite frequently be a code smell,

192
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,510
If you're setting up
your own environment,

193
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,070
your own little application,

194
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,455
and you've got multiple
inheritance going on,

195
00:09:57,455 --> 00:10:00,065
I'm not going to say that
you're doing the wrong thing,

196
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:03,995
but what I am going to say is
that's frequently a code smell,

197
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:07,475
Chances are you're not pointed
in the right direction,

198
00:10:07,475 --> 00:10:10,245
Now, if you are creating
a re-useable framework,

199
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:12,560
then absolutely this could be

200
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,350
one of the solutions that
you decide to choose from,

201
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,405
Again, you'll see this
in a lot of frameworks,

202
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:18,965
Django being my favorite,

203
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:22,220
I love Django, Django is
near and dear to my heart,

204
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,285
So you might be using this with
some additional frameworks,

205
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:28,730
You might be creating

206
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,990
your own framework where you're

207
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,700
going to simulate
something like that,

208
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,590
But typically for most

209
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,405
of the applications that
you're going to be using,

210
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:37,760
setting up a multiple
inheritance hierarchy,

211
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,625
probably not what you're
looking for, Code smell,

212
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:44,860
Using a framework that
uses multiple inheritance,

213
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,010
that's something that is very common,

214
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,590
All that being said,

215
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,380
let's go ahead and take
a look at our code demo,
