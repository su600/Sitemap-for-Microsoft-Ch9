00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:06,360
>> Hi there, Welcome to yet
another Python series in

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,590
case you or sick of us
already we're back for more,

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,230
This time we're going to focus in
on some tools for data science,

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,835
Now, before we get into it,

5
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:19,290
there's really three main questions

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,805
that we want to be able to answer,

7
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:22,745
Who are we, who are you

8
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:25,230
and what is it that we're
going to be doing here?

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,810
So let's start off
with, well, who are we?

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,960
>> So my name is Susan Ibach and I am

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,635
definitely a data geek also
known as hockeygeekgirl online,

12
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,450
and one of the things that
I loved to do when I'm

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,340
not sitting in front
of a terminal coding,

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,200
I'm probably either maybe running

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,735
a marathon or maybe listening
some good thrash fan,

16
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:46,595
>> As for me, I'm
Christopher Harrison,

17
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:50,440
I've been a geek for about
as long as I can remember,

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,270
I'm now a Program Manager at or with

19
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,425
academic ecosystems
inside of Microsoft,

20
00:00:56,425 --> 00:00:58,515
I've a propensity to tell dad jokes,

21
00:00:58,515 --> 00:00:59,670
as well as saying the word

22
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,300
"Propensity" I'm a
husband, I'm a marathoner,

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,550
and I'm a father of
a four-legged child,

24
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,275
also known as a dog,

25
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:14,030
So let's talk a little bit
then about like expectations,

26
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,710
prerequisites, if
you will, basically,

27
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,720
who are you and why is

28
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,435
it that you might be interested
in something like this?

29
00:01:20,435 --> 00:01:23,105
So the assumption that we're
making is that you've done

30
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:26,030
a little bit of Python
and you're looking to

31
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,780
just get in and start to
explore data science that

32
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,520
maybe there's a quick start
that you'll want to check

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,590
out and you're just trying
to figure out like,

34
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,530
what are these different
things that I'm being told to

35
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,065
just follow along with
and just run some code,

36
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:45,420
Hopefully, we'll explain some of
what's going on inside of there,

37
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,175
>> Yeah, because a lot of times,

38
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:49,160
a lot of people get into
Python because I have

39
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,320
an interest in exploring
that world of data science,

40
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,779
but opening up that first
data science tutorial,

41
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:56,480
you've got all the data science
concepts and at the same time

42
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,670
all kinds of new Python libraries

43
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,470
and debates that you might
not be familiar with,

44
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,650
So what we're hoping here
is introduce you to some of

45
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,260
those Python tools and some of

46
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,730
those libraries so that maybe

47
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,350
when you do that data
science tutorial,

48
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,140
you can focus more on just
new data science concepts,

49
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,360
>> Yeah, so that's really what it

50
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,930
is that we're going to be doing
here, is introducing those,

51
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,640
those libraries, walk you

52
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,890
through some common
tools and techniques,

53
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,080
and navigate through
some common scenarios,

54
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,220
The way that we're going to
be doing it is by walking

55
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,054
through really some basic scenarios,

56
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:34,130
and you'll notice that
there'll be a little bit of

57
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,905
a common thread throughout
a lot of these modules,

58
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:38,450
where a lot of these modules,

59
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,005
a lot of these concepts will
build on the ones prior,

60
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:45,320
That being said, there still
all designed to be snackable,

61
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,910
all just like really short,

62
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,320
So you can jump in,

63
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,830
take a look at the particular
tools concepts that you need,

64
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,465
and then jump back out from there,

65
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,370
>> Yeah, but you'll find
it easiest to learn

66
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,990
these particular series if you
do watch them sequentially,

67
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,270
You can still skip

68
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,980
the PowerPoint presentation and jump

69
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,930
straight to demos if you're one
of those people who are just,

70
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,220
"Just show me the code in

71
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,440
action" You can still
absolutely do that,

72
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,600
just follow the code modules,

73
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,930
but you will probably
find easier to follow

74
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,210
the concepts if you do
the modules in order,

75
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,005
>> Yes, so let's head on into it,

76
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:17,800
>> Let's start coding,
