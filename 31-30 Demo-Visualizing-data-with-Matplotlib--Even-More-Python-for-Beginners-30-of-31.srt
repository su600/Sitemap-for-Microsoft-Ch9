00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
>> Let's get in and take a look
at a little bit of code here,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,280
So just like before,

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,250
we're going to bring in our
pandas library and we're

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,280
going to load in that
exact same data,

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,470
So nothing new here,

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,660
But now what we want to do is we

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,270
want to start plotting
everything out,

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,570
So we're going to bring
in our Matplotlib,

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,000
and then we're going to plot
directly from that DataFrame,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,995
So what I want you to notice here

11
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,320
is the fact that we're setting up

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,530
a scatter chart or

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,730
a scatter plot rather that we're
going to do x is the distance,

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,445
y as the arrival delay,

15
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:42,875
When we see this,

16
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,980
what we're going to notice is that,

17
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,200
give it a moment here,

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,010
that there is no correlation between

19
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,070
those values that we're
seeing a true scatter plot,

20
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,360
We have got values
scattered everywhere,

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,010
If we take a look though at something

22
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,785
that's definitely going
to be tied together,

23
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:04,295
which is the departure
delay and arrival delay,

24
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:07,070
now what we're going to
see is a different result,

25
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,960
Again, give this just a second here,

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,575
and now we can see that
little chart going across,

27
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:14,645
It's really the exact same code,

28
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:18,805
the only thing that we changed
was just the xy columns here,

29
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:22,695
So there is everything,

30
00:01:22,695 --> 00:01:26,960
Now I'd like to get that neat
little red line there slapped down,

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,460
and I'm going to do that by using

32
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,940
a little bit of linear regression,

33
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:37,010
So let's bring in everything
for our linear regression here,

34
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,760
and I'm not going to dig
too deep into this code,

35
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,950
You can go check out the prior module

36
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,995
where we talked about
linear regression,

37
00:01:44,995 --> 00:01:47,045
The thing that I want you
to notice is that we're

38
00:01:47,045 --> 00:01:48,950
going through the exact same steps

39
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,180
that we're dropping the null values,

40
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,590
we're setting up our x,

41
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,985
So this is the feature,

42
00:01:56,985 --> 00:02:00,830
This is what's going to drive the
value as the departure delay,

43
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,210
We're going to set up

44
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,225
the arrival delay as the
value we want to predict,

45
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:09,670
that's going to put that on a
nice neat little line for us,

46
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:15,594
and then we're going to
execute our regressor,

47
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,990
and then get the
prediction values back,

48
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:23,330
So now, I've got all of that
inside of the y predict,

49
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,715
So now let's build up that chart,

50
00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:30,150
So right here, we've got our X_test,

51
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,240
Let me just type out here real quick,

52
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,230
that is going to be
the departure delay,

53
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,065
and then right here that Y_predict,

54
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:46,160
this is now going to be that
smoothed out arrival delay there,

55
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,645
That's going to be

56
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:49,760
that neat little line that

57
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,655
the linear regression
model created for us,

58
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:57,040
So that's going to be our
x and our y respectively,

59
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,515
So now, I can run that and there is

60
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:04,345
that neat little red line that
we were just talking about,

61
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:07,805
Let's say I want to see that on
top of the scatter plot data,

62
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:09,950
well, that's right here,

63
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,230
So what you're going to
notice is one more time we're

64
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,845
plotting everything out
just like we did before,

65
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:18,630
We're setting up our scatter
plot just like we did before,

66
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,590
The main difference really
is just the fact that we're

67
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,995
calling bulk plot and scatter here,

68
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:28,100
So now when we call show
down at the very bottom,

69
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,570
it's going to put both onto
one nice neat little graph,

70
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,710
and now we can see
that red line going

71
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,735
across all of our scattered values,

72
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:43,575
So that's how we can use

73
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:45,230
our scatter plot to get

74
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,170
a real good sense of what's
going on with our data,

75
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,130
So we can see whether or not there
is correlation, and in turn,

76
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,530
we can even use linear
regression just to

77
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,020
get a nice neat little
line that we can

78
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,150
slap down to be able to better get

79
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,940
a sense for what's
going on with our data,
