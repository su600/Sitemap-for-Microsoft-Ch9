00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,290
>> So whenever you start working with

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,510
data science and you're
working with Python,

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,010
at some point, you're going to be
needing to load some data files,

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,925
The most common data file format
you'll likely be working with

5
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:15,135
is a CSV file or a comma
separated variable file,

6
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:16,790
One of the things we
just want to touch on

7
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,545
is what does that look like and

8
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:20,000
how do I work with those files when

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,525
I'm working inside
of Jupyter Notebook?

10
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:25,100
So comma separated variable files or

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,280
CSV files is extremely popular
format for data files,

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,795
So a lot of times when you're
going off and searching for data,

13
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:32,315
this will be the format it's in,

14
00:00:32,315 --> 00:00:34,340
What you'll see is each
row, the file contains

15
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,710
one record and you'll
have a special character,

16
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,090
often a comma, that's used to

17
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,950
separate the different column values,

18
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,270
The first row may

19
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,330
contain actually the names
of the different columns,

20
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,530
so you know what is
the value in each row,

21
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,440
So you can see here I've got
the name, city, and country,

22
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,580
Then I have the name, city,

23
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,230
and country for a number of
different airports, for example,

24
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,020
So that might be a CSV file that I

25
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,115
might use to analyze inside my data,

26
00:00:57,115 --> 00:01:01,570
Now if you want to use this data
file inside of Jupyter Notebook,

27
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,930
you're going to have to make sure

28
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,955
the Notebook can find
the physical file,

29
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:06,455
So how do I do it?

30
00:01:06,455 --> 00:01:09,740
Well, I'm going to upload
the files to Jupyter itself,

31
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,140
Now one of the things that's
a really good practice

32
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,830
is to take that file and
create a sub folder,

33
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,080
and most common name for the sub
folder is something like data,

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,390
not very original but
nice and descriptive,

35
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,430
So we create a sub
folder called data,

36
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,410
you upload all your files into there,

37
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,185
and then we'll be able to
access it from a Notebook,

38
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:28,485
So we first have to
create the folder,

39
00:01:28,485 --> 00:01:30,455
and then once we've done that,

40
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:32,675
there's an upload option
to upload our files,

41
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:36,540
Let's move over to Jupyter
Notebooks and try that out,
