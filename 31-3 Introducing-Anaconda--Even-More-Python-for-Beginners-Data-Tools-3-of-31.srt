00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,850
>> Christopher just took
you through some of

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,220
the things we can do
with Jupyter Notebooks,

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,660
Now, one of the challenges you're

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,070
going to work with when
you start playing with

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,720
Jupyter notebooks is
yet some other tools

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,950
you might need to work with as well,

7
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,350
specifically Anaconda and Conda,

8
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,855
Anaconda is an open
source distribution

9
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:23,145
of Python and R often
used for data science,

10
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:24,700
When you install Anaconda,

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,210
it comes with about 1500 different
packages that you can use,

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,720
It has this graphical interface
called Anaconda Navigator,

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,630
It also has a command
line interface called

14
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,770
Anaconda Prompt and it also
comes with a tool called Conda,

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,410
So Conda is a tool that you can

16
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,540
use to create a managed
Python environments,

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,240
Now back in the original
introduction to Python series,

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,360
we talked about how we could use
virtual environments to manage

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,760
all the different packages we
work with when we're coding

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,445
in Python and the different
versions of Python,

21
00:00:55,445 --> 00:00:57,960
So that becomes important
with notebooks as well,

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,410
But we tend to use Conda
when we need to manage

23
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,050
packages and environments
for Jupyter Notebooks,

24
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,310
So what you're going to
want to do is install

25
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,590
Anaconda and then after
you've installed Anaconda,

26
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,220
you just launch the Anaconda prompt

27
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,235
and then to create a virtual
environment using Conda,

28
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:18,180
you use the Conda create command,

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,090
you give your environment
a name and you

30
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,435
specify the version of Python,
you're going to be running,

31
00:01:22,435 --> 00:01:25,340
The dash y there is
simply a way of saying,

32
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,500
if you ask me questions to
confirm is this running,

33
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,525
just answer yes to the
questions by default,

34
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:32,600
just so you understand what
that little dash y is doing,

35
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,640
So you just have to come up
with a name for the Notebook

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,315
and know which version of
Python you want to work with,

37
00:01:37,315 --> 00:01:39,605
Once you created the environment,

38
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:41,095
then you can activate it,

39
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:43,110
So you simply tell Conda,

40
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,790
tell it to activate your Notebook,

41
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,400
A couple of other useful commands you

42
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,810
might need down the
road if you need to

43
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,215
deactivate your environment
to move back and forth,

44
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:53,180
you have Conda deactivate and if

45
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,995
you no longer need an environment,

46
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:57,080
you can delete it by
using the Conda remove

47
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,265
command once you have
activated an environment,

48
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:02,690
So you create an environment,

49
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,235
you activate an environment,

50
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:06,380
then you can install the libraries

51
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,855
you're going to use
inside that environment,

52
00:02:08,855 --> 00:02:11,285
So we can install pandas,

53
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:14,450
you might be installing things
like Matplotlib, NumPy,

54
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,640
These are some of the libraries
you're going to start getting to

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,595
know if you start exploring
that world of data science,

56
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:21,355
so you may need to install them,

57
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:22,940
Otherwise what will happen is when

58
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,230
you are running Jupyter Notebooks,

59
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,330
you're going to see error
messages coming back saying,

60
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,100
I don't know what Matplotlib is,

61
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,125
so this is how we're going
to fix that problem,

62
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,330
After you've installed the libraries

63
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,980
that you need to use for your code

64
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,780
you're also going to install Jupyter

65
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,245
itself for the Jupyter Notebooks,

66
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:39,710
If at any point you lose

67
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,420
track of which libraries
you've already installed,

68
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,010
you can always use Conda list to get

69
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,660
a list of all the
installed libraries,

70
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,245
Once you've installed but you need,

71
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:51,650
you can simply launch Jupyter
Notebooks from inside

72
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,320
the active environment and
now your code should be

73
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,700
able to access all the libraries
you need to do your coding,

74
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,425
Couple of little tips
that might be useful,

75
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:02,540
I've run into this before,
when you're back in

76
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,770
the command line
environment and you've

77
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,540
launched Jupyter Notebooks
and you want to go back,

78
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,055
maybe installed an extra package,

79
00:03:07,055 --> 00:03:09,740
Control C will take you back to

80
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,100
the Anaconda Prompt and

81
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,090
sometimes after you've
installed a package,

82
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,220
I find it doesn't seem to
recognize it right away

83
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,530
when I launch the Jupyter
Notebook, and that happens to me,

84
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,030
I usually find if I deactivate

85
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,320
the environment and
activate it again,

86
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,150
it usually works,
doesn't happen often,

87
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,265
but it's something you can try
if you run into that issue,

88
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:27,870
All right, let's try it,
