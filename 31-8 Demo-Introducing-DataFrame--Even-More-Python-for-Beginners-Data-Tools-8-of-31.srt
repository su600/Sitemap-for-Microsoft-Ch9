00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
>> Let's see how we could explore

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,430
a DataFrame using a
little bit of code,

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,525
So let's first again import in

4
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:13,635
our pandas and let's
create that DataFrame,

5
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:15,900
Now you might be wondering, hey,

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,840
why in the world would you start
exploring a DataFrame when

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,740
you've hard-coded in what
that's going to look like?

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,440
Again, you're exactly right,

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,940
We're going to show
a little bit later

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,650
how we can load up some data,

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,930
We just want a simple
DataFrame that we

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,810
could start to show off
some of the skills,

13
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,290
So that way when it comes time
to load up some data that we

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,180
know better of what's

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,340
going on and how to start
exploring all of that,

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,885
So there we go,

17
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:44,790
I'm just going to
create my DataFrame,

18
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,090
There it all is, and
now let's explore it,

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,030
So like we mentioned before,

20
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,250
head will give us the ability to see

21
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,525
the top three rows
because I specify three,

22
00:00:56,525 --> 00:00:58,819
If I specify two for example,

23
00:00:58,819 --> 00:01:01,700
as you might expect that
it's going to give us back

24
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,515
just simply those two items,

25
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:09,350
Five, I think you'll start to
see where all of this as going,

26
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,465
it will just give you
back that number of rows,

27
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:14,105
If you want to start from the bottom,

28
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:16,640
then you could simply use tail,

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,875
and that will just count
up from the bottom,

30
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,270
So if we take a look,

31
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,060
you'll notice that there
is the bottom of that,

32
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,489
Certainly, it'll read
a Pearson and Changi,

33
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:28,250
and if we take a look over here,

34
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,545
we can see back in our
original DataFrame,

35
00:01:30,545 --> 00:01:34,815
that's exactly what we've got there,

36
00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:38,460
If I just want to see
what's the shape,

37
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,980
what does it look
like, seven and three,

38
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,710
Again, remember that the

39
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,855
three is giving us the
number of data columns,

40
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,450
so it's not counting the index,

41
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,205
Then finally, I can see
the full info of that,

42
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:54,530
So I can see the columns,

43
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,850
I can see the names,

44
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,365
I can see how many items in
there are not null, etc,

45
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:03,755
I would say of all the information
that's going to give you,

46
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:06,710
the none null is probably going to

47
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,950
be one of the most important
things because working with

48
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,875
null values can really be

49
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,350
a struggle because sometimes

50
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,750
they'll indicate that
there's just missing data,

51
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,240
Sometimes, it will
indicator condition,

52
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,535
when you start doing math with them,

53
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:25,315
things start to go
sideways very quickly,

54
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:28,105
Null values are really a struggle,

55
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:30,645
So being able to see
real quickly, hey,

56
00:02:30,645 --> 00:02:34,970
what's my data look like is
going to be really powerful,

57
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,135
and it really is going to
be probably the first thing

58
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:41,525
you will always do when
you load up some data,

59
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:43,730
especially data that
you're not overly familiar

60
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,910
with to see what it is
that you're working with,

61
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,100
Now you've got the tools
to be able to do that,
