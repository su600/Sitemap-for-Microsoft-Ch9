00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,350
>> Well, if you made it this far,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,390
then I guess the last
thing that we have to

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,685
say at this point is thank you,

4
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:11,700
We also want to encourage you to get

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,120
in and really start playing
with all the different tips,

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,895
tricks, and tools that
we've demoed here,

7
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:23,460
>> You got some of those
Python skills ready,

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,130
now is perfect time to go look
for some data science tutorials,

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,320
check out some of the stuff
on Microsoft Learn at

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,570
docs,Microsoft,com, some
of the quick starts,

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,310
You can find some
really great tutorials

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,870
to get started with machine learning,

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,640
training models, and it should be a

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,770
little easier now because you
already know some of the code,

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,600
>> So if you're looking for

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,225
specific spots to go
in and start looking,

17
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:45,080
check out the GitHub repository
that we've linked to,

18
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,145
You're going to notice that
we curated a handful of

19
00:00:49,145 --> 00:00:53,980
nice next steps and how you can
continue growing from there,

20
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,635
So now's the perfect time,

21
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:57,615
start writing some
code, Thanks again,

22
00:00:57,615 --> 00:00:59,950
>> Thanks again, See you next time,
