1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,860
>> Okay, Well, thank you very
much for making it this far,

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,530
I do want to apologize for

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,300
any bad jokes that we
might have delivered here,

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,730
But otherwise, hopefully
you've picked up a couple

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,300
of new little tips and tricks
with regards to Python,

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,070
>> Yeah, Now that you've had

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,900
a chance again to look
at some new features,

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,895
the big thing to do
is to practice it,

9
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:26,680
otherwise, you're going to
forget what you've learned,

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,195
That's the best way to reinforce it,

11
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,980
So you want to go out,
find some quickstarts,

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,930
read some tutorials, and get

13
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,030
in there and try out some of
the things you just learned,

14
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,455
>> Yeah, Right along those lines,

15
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:37,150
we've actually got some quickstarts,

16
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,730
and tutorials are ready for you,

17
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,160
that if you go check out the
GitHub repository on there,

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,450
you're going to notice that we've got

19
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,930
all level links into
both the documentation,

20
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,785
as well as to a lot of new
little Microsoft learn modules,

21
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,795
some various quickstarts, and

22
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:56,375
other tutorials that
you can work through,

23
00:00:56,375 --> 00:01:01,110
that are really a great next
logical step from here,

24
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,260
I don't know, maybe we'll be back,

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,195
maybe we'll do another set of videos,

26
00:01:06,195 --> 00:01:08,045
>> We just did more Python beginners,

27
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:10,580
maybe somewhere down the road
will need even more Python,

28
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,470
So meanwhile, happy coding,
