00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,535
>> Welcome back for more
Python for beginners,

2
00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:09,390
That probably the number one
request that Susan and I

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,305
got after putting together the
last set of videos was well,

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,870
for more videos and so
that's what we want to

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,525
do here is give more videos,

6
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:20,070
So we want to start off like we

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,855
did last time with a
couple of questions,

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,210
So who are we, who are you,

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,210
and what is it that we're
going to be doing today?

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,805
So let's start here,
Susan, who are you?

11
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:31,380
>> Well, if you've watched

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,420
the introduction to Python
videos and hopefully you have,

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,100
if not, go back, check them out,

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,795
My name is Susan Ibach,

15
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:38,850
I also go by hockey geek girl,

16
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,160
By the way, that is
Susan Ibach with a B not

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,920
Imac which I saw a several people
on YouTube commenting about,

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,375
When I'm not in front of a keyboard

19
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,830
playing around with code and data,

20
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,810
I'm also a mom,

21
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,170
a marathoner and a thrash metal fan,

22
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,075
>> Yeah, I'm Christopher Harrison,

23
00:00:56,075 --> 00:00:57,770
I'm a longtime geek,

24
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,390
I'm a program manager inside of

25
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,915
academic ecosystems
here in Cloud and AI,

26
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:05,510
I have a propensity to
tell bad jokes as well

27
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,925
as a propensity to say
the word propensity,

28
00:01:07,925 --> 00:01:09,724
I'm a husband marathoner,

29
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:12,020
and father of a four-legged child,

30
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,305
also known as a dog,

31
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:15,750
She is an adorable,

32
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,885
about a year and a half mastiff mix,

33
00:01:18,885 --> 00:01:22,085
So yeah, So then who are you?

34
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:26,615
Well, the target audience for
this course is somebody who

35
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:32,240
has gone through that Python for
Beginners course and is well,

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,225
looking for more
Python for beginners,

37
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:36,410
that was really it,

38
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,665
That Python is
obviously a huge topic,

39
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:42,220
we weren't able to get through
everything the first time,

40
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,030
We are going to be assuming

41
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,520
that you have some level
of Python knowledge,

42
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,650
If you don't, go check
out the other videos

43
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,560
first before coming back to this one,

44
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,620
If you've already done that,

45
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,850
or maybe you like, "Hey,

46
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,485
I'm really curious about, say,

47
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:59,390
the with statement or
I'm really curious

48
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,520
about multiple inheritance," then you

49
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,720
can just dive in and go choose
those particular videos,

50
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,250
>> That's right, You
don't have to follow

51
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,320
this particular set
of VOC sequentially,

52
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,730
There's a few that for example,

53
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,320
it helps to look at the classes video

54
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,955
before you look at
multiple inheritance,

55
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:17,540
but you don't have to do every
single module of this series,

56
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,860
So this one is designed such

57
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,300
that if it's something
you really want to learn,

58
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,895
you can jump into one directly,

59
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:26,810
>> Exactly, Yeah, So probably
the most common question

60
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,070
that we got was,

61
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,830
"Hey, what about this?
What about that?

62
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,690
Can we see coverage of this?"

63
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,420
That really is what it is
that we're trying to do here,

64
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,320
So we want to help
empower you even more,

65
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,190
We want to give you more
tools for your toolbox,

66
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,130
that old saying, if the only
tool you have is a hammer,

67
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,220
everything looks like a nail,

68
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,000
That really that same thing
here that we want to show you

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,435
some additional things that
you can do with Python,

70
00:02:53,435 --> 00:02:54,890
So that way if you decide,

71
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,960
"Hey, I want to dig
a little bit deeper,

72
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,810
that maybe I want to
start looking at Django,

73
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,020
near and dear to my heart,

74
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,245
" or something like that,

75
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:06,170
that hopefully you'll be able to
look at even more quickstarts,

76
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,660
even more tutorials, and understand

77
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,230
what it is that's going
on with that code,

78
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,290
>> Yes, Just trying to build

79
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,225
your confidence and answer
some of the questions

80
00:03:14,225 --> 00:03:15,860
you gave to us and

81
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,095
requests that you gave to
us after the first series,

82
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:19,670
>> Yeah, So with that,

83
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,725
let's get in and start coding,

84
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:24,000
>> Yeah, Time to have some fun,
