1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,640
>> Chances are, staring at
a bunch of numbers isn't

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,240
necessarily going to give
you a lot of insights,

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,445
Sometimes that's what you need

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:14,550
but a lot of times it's
nice to have a picture,

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,600
The old saying, "A pictures
worth a thousand words," I

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,515
guess it's worth some
level of numbers as well,

7
00:00:22,515 --> 00:00:23,970
and that's what we want to explore

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,805
here is how we can
lay down some charts

9
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:31,980
and start to see what's
going on with our data,

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,440
Now, one big thing
that we're going to,

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,375
one be on the lookout form,

12
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:40,320
is some level of correlation
in our data that

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,620
sometimes we're looking for

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,960
something that's relatively
high level of just,

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,110
"Hey, real quick, does X impact Y?"

16
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,655
Sometimes it's because we
want to remove items out

17
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:55,100
of our training data

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,995
because that could wind
up skewing our results,

19
00:00:57,995 --> 00:01:00,500
So for example, if we were

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,960
looking at something
where we were trying to

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,420
predict something and we had

22
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,670
both maybe the amount that somebody

23
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,060
spent on a plane ticket
and their fare class,

24
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,315
Well, chance are there's going
to be pretty tightly correlated,

25
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:18,350
Because generally speaking,
the more money that you spend,

26
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,600
the higher of a class

27
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,985
that you're going to wind
up with on the plane,

28
00:01:22,985 --> 00:01:26,660
So sometimes we need to remove
that data or sometimes we just

29
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,305
want to go in and explore and
see those types of things,

30
00:01:30,305 --> 00:01:32,670
So that's what we're looking for it,

31
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,580
One way that we can do this is
through the use of a Scatterplot,

32
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,445
The scatterplot is a
really common chart type

33
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:41,780
where what's going to

34
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,920
happen is a dot is going to
be drawn out on your chart,

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,375
that's me drawing dots,

36
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,195
A dot is going to be drawn everywhere

37
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:54,885
on that chart where X meets Y,

38
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:58,685
So now, I can see based on
where all of those dots are,

39
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,020
what the values are,

40
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,430
what the scatter is,

41
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,080
what the full range is of

42
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,770
all the values that are
going to be on there?

43
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,210
It's very useful for then checking
correlation between columns,

44
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:15,695
So if you're going to notice
that there is that correlation

45
00:02:15,695 --> 00:02:20,525
where the value of one changes
along with the value of another,

46
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:25,175
then we're going to see that
inside of our scatterplot,

47
00:02:25,175 --> 00:02:28,355
So if we break this down to a
couple of a real-world examples,

48
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:32,810
you are going to notice that
there's a correlation between,

49
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,425
say, car accidents on a
particular day and snowfall,

50
00:02:36,425 --> 00:02:38,330
But you're probably
not going to notice

51
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,325
much of a correlation between

52
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:45,550
snowfall and the stock price
of Microsoft on any given day,

53
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,530
We can stop here and have

54
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,160
a conversation about correlation
and causation and so forth,

55
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,240
that's a little bit beyond
what we're looking for,

56
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,870
What we're really looking
forward today is just,

57
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,800
"Hey, is there correlation?"

58
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,620
So a couple of scatterplots,

59
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,195
you can see right there,

60
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:06,860
Correlation, you'll notice
that real nice tight band

61
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,560
that's going from the lower
left towards the upper right,

62
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,090
and then no correlation,

63
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,545
You'll notice that my values
are just simply well,

64
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:16,880
scattered and so that's

65
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,305
a really nice indicator
of what's going on there,

66
00:03:20,305 --> 00:03:25,815
We can use Matplotlib
to draw out our graphs,

67
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:29,465
So if we have a DataFrame,

68
00:03:29,465 --> 00:03:31,910
we're going to be able to use
that to draw everything out,

69
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,400
We are going to need the Library,

70
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,980
So we'll pull that in
right there and then,

71
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,120
we'll be able to actually draw
chart directly from our DataFrame,

72
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,215
So what I want you to notice
about this code plot here,

73
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:47,175
is the fact that,

74
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:51,710
we are and I'll just go ahead
and draw this out here,

75
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,070
So what we're going to do is we're
going to load up our CSV file,

76
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,020
We've already seen how to do that,

77
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,650
So not really a whole
lot going on there,

78
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,650
and now we're going to
plot everything out,

79
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,210
So we're going to indicate, "Hey,

80
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,165
we want a scatterplot,

81
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:08,960
We're going to indicate what we want

82
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,930
the X and the Y values to be,"

83
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,690
So the X is going to be
distance and then the Y

84
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,830
is going to be our arrival delay,

85
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,850
You'll notice the color,

86
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,155
you'll notice the title,

87
00:04:21,155 --> 00:04:23,060
Both of those are
pretty straightforward,

88
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,540
The one that I want to
highlight here is the Alpha,

89
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,970
What the Alpha is going to do,

90
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,720
it's a zero to one base number,

91
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,110
Is it's going to indicate
how lightly or how

92
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,235
heavily drawn each one of
those dots is going to be,

93
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:42,180
By default the Alpha is one,

94
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,060
meaning that's going to be
a just a completely dark

95
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,180
dot if we lighten that though,

96
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,380
Now what we're going to notice is
that a single dot is going to be

97
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,090
a lighter color and if there's like

98
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,920
two dots that are top of one another,

99
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,989
or maybe they're just
slightly offset,

100
00:04:56,989 --> 00:04:59,090
then what we're going to notice is

101
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,160
that it'll get a little
darker with two dots,

102
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,745
and then three dots, and then
four dots, and then five dots,

103
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:06,050
So that way if I'm looking at data

104
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,360
where I've got a lot
of points that are

105
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,980
going to be inside of

106
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,040
my chart and I'm trying
to get a better sense of,

107
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,520
"Hey, where are things
grouped together?"

108
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,780
I can do that by
setting a lower Alpha,

109
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,670
So now, I'm going to see

110
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,990
darker colors where there's
more overlap values,

111
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,750
Then we go ahead in call show,

112
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,040
and then what will happen is it
will then display everything out,

113
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,050
What I want you to notice
here, first of all,

114
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,330
is the fact that there's
not a correlation

115
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,985
between distance and arrival delay,

116
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:43,385
which might have been a
little bit surprising,

117
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,340
I figured there would have been
some level of correlation,

118
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,480
but we can see that there's

119
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,430
just dots scattered
all over the place,

120
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,800
so no real strong correlation there,

121
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,585
The other thing that
you're going to notice,

122
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:56,255
is the fact that we've got just

123
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,160
a lot of values really
down towards the bottom,

124
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,945
So there's just not a lot
of delay for a lot of

125
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:06,185
our flights and those outliers

126
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:09,425
are then just that really
faint color there,

127
00:06:09,425 --> 00:06:11,690
So it's a really nice way to get

128
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,520
an overview of how our data looks,

129
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,130
Now we can also go in and

130
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,790
break things down across
multiple lines as well,

131
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,180
So we don't necessarily have to
go directly from the DataFrame,

132
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,640
Maybe we want to be able to break
this down into multiple lines,

133
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,090
Maybe because we want to
be able to reuse things,

134
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,130
maybe because we want to
make it more readable,

135
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,300
Maybe because we just want

136
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,580
a little bit more power and
we just want to be able to

137
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,305
control exactly how our chart
is going to be laid out,

138
00:06:41,305 --> 00:06:45,060
So this will actually do
almost the exact same thing,

139
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,250
The only difference is the fact
that we're going to be using

140
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,530
the Departure Delay and

141
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,420
the Arrival Delay to display
everything out and so now,

142
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,040
we can see that nice
tight correlation there,

143
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,480
We can already start to see, "Hey,

144
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,775
there's an obvious align
that's forming there,"

145
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:07,190
Because we've got
our departure delay,

146
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,349
our arrival delay, and obviously

147
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:12,035
makes sense that there's
a tight correlation,

148
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:15,815
But we also have a little bit of,

149
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:20,675
I don't know, like a little
something going on over here,

150
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:24,065
So it'd be nice to
be able to just slap

151
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:27,500
down a line right across here,

152
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,890
So that way I can hopefully
better visualize,

153
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:35,195
how all of those numbers
are coming together?

154
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:38,120
So this is actually where we

155
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,030
could use a little bit
of linear regression,

156
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,045
That linear regression,
isn't necessarily

157
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:47,240
only used to try and be
able to predict values,

158
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,160
Sometimes it can be really

159
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,160
helpful to be able to
just have it draw a line,

160
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,405
The name linear there is
not just a clever name,

161
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:59,020
It's all about being able
to draw a lines there,

162
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,000
So let's take our data
and let's feed that

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,155
then into a linear regression model,

164
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:07,440
and then when we get our value back,

165
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,940
now let's go ahead and
snap down that red line,

166
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,685
So this is really that same
data that we saw previously,

167
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:18,260
The only difference is now we run

168
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,825
it through a little bit
of linear regression,

169
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:24,770
So the y-value, that y predicted,

170
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,980
is going to be the prediction of

171
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,140
the arrival delay and

172
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,250
that's what's going to give
us that nice red line,

173
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,190
Then we can use that
model to then overlay

174
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,240
that on top of our data and see
that nice neat little line,

175
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,600
So there one more time
is a little bit of code,

176
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,520
You're going to notice
that we're going

177
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,830
to draw everything out with

178
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,150
that nice red color and
then we're going to

179
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,005
create this scatterplot down below,

180
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:56,870
where we've got everything
laid out in blue,

181
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,720
So the end result is
going to wind up being

182
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,990
a nice neat little chart
here where we've got

183
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,750
all of those row values and then

184
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,655
the linear regression model
laid right on top of that,

185
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:14,090
Now we can see can a nice
and clearly how it is

186
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:19,495
that our departure delay is
impacting our arrival delay?

187
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:22,070
Let's turn our attention to the code

188
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,560
so that way we can see
all of this in action,
