00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
>> Let's see our little
framework in action here,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,520
So what I've got is

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,385
my two little classes here
of loggable and connection,

4
00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:14,670
Again, what loggable is going
to do for me is enable logging,

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,125
my connection is going to allow
me then to handle my connection,

6
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:23,730
Setting up the couple of
properties for title and server,

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,450
and then setting up the couple
little functions that are

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,990
going to simulate whatever it is
that we're trying to do here,

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,180
So in my case, it's going
to be writing out to

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,110
the log file and connecting
out to the database,

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,890
Then what you're going to
notice is that I've got

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,210
my little SQL database
that I'm creating here,

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,310
My little SQL database
is then going to

14
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,935
inherit from both
connection and loggable,

15
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:54,975
We're going to set up the
title and the server,

16
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:57,185
Then what you're going
to notice right here is,

17
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:59,630
here's our little fancy framework,

18
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,390
Our fancy framework is
going to check to see,

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,400
hey, did we inherit from connection?

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,800
If we did, we'll run
the connect code,

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,330
Hey, did we inherit from Loggable?

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,475
If we did, then we'll go
ahead and run the log code,

23
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:15,050
Actually I'm going to
move this down real quick

24
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,250
here just because I'm going to want

25
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,170
to play around with a
couple of things here,

26
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,280
so I'm just going to move that down,

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,755
No big thing going on there,
so just move that down,

28
00:01:22,755 --> 00:01:25,035
So there's my little framework,

29
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:29,190
Now, I'm going to go ahead
and use the framework,

30
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,465
So I'm going to inherit from

31
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:38,220
connection and the Loggable
to enable that behavior,

32
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,930
So now, when I create
the instance and I go

33
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,800
ahead and pass it through
my high-end framework,

34
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,950
What I'm going to notice is that
it's going to tell me that it's

35
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,340
logging the SQL connection demo

36
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,830
and that it's connecting
to some server,

37
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,685
There we go, Sure enough,

38
00:02:02,685 --> 00:02:04,275
that's exactly what we get,

39
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:08,895
So it's connecting out to the
database, log the message,

40
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:13,385
Because again, that is what we
went ahead and inherited from,

41
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:17,980
Now, what's great about this
little framework that I've created

42
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:23,140
here is the fact that if I
want to do something else,

43
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,665
so let's say that I'm going
to create a brand new class,

44
00:02:26,665 --> 00:02:29,750
and this is going to
be just a logger,

45
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,515
Then what I can do is just
inherit from Loggable,

46
00:02:34,515 --> 00:02:40,660
I can go ahead and set up
my init just like that,

47
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,745
and we don't care about the super,

48
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:46,670
Then I'm going to say self,title,

49
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,410
You'll notice that I get IntelliSense

50
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,915
here because I'm
inheriting from Loggable,

51
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:54,370
Except that to be just logging,

52
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,345
go ahead and save that,

53
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:02,345
Let's go ahead and create
a brand new instance,

54
00:03:02,345 --> 00:03:08,590
So we'll say, just_log
equal to JustLog,

55
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,660
Then we'll go ahead and
just log like that,

56
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,500
Pass that in again to our
very fancy framework,

57
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,235
Now, what we're going to
notice is the fact that

58
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:23,110
it's only going to do our logging,

59
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,150
So now with this framework,

60
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,550
what I've enabled for
developers that are

61
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,175
going to be using
this is that ability,

62
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:34,505
So if you want to be able to
connect, you can do that,

63
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,170
If you want to be able to log,

64
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,355
you can do that,

65
00:03:37,355 --> 00:03:43,715
So really a nice way to set up
and work with that framework,

66
00:03:43,715 --> 00:03:46,325
So like I mentioned at the outset,

67
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:50,840
we want to typically avoid setting

68
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,055
up multiple inheritance when
we're writing our own code,

69
00:03:55,055 --> 00:03:56,975
unless we happen to be
setting up a framework,

70
00:03:56,975 --> 00:04:00,400
but instead we will be
using it quite frequently,

71
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,895
So when we're using other frameworks,

72
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:05,900
So if you're heading out and
maybe learning Django or

73
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,200
learning another framework
that depends upon Mixin's,

74
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,090
this is the magic that's happening,

75
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,955
That you inherit from
yet another class,

76
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:17,150
you go ahead and set up
a couple of properties,

77
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,830
maybe set up a couple of methods,

78
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,230
and then voila something really

79
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,945
cool is now happening
inside of your application,

80
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:25,955
This is what's making it happen,

81
00:04:25,955 --> 00:04:28,355
It's doing exactly what I did here,

82
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:30,710
It's checking to see, did
you inherit from a class?

83
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,810
If you did, then we'll go ahead

84
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,000
and call a couple of things on that,

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,940
So that is multiple inheritance
and Mixins in Python,
