00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,635
>> Let's see how we
can set up our model,

2
00:00:04,635 --> 00:00:08,505
So what we're going to do
as previously mentioned,

3
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:11,100
is we're going to bring in

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,735
our pandas library and bring
up our train test split,

5
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:18,060
We're going to do exactly
what we did before,

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,830
So I'm not going to
spend a lot of time

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,630
walking back through this code,

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,010
but this is what we've seen,

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,710
that we've seen how
to read in the CSV,

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:32,840
We've seen how to drop our values
that are null or otherwise,

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,995
We're going to then go grab
our distance and elapsed time,

12
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,110
We're going to grab our arrival delay

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,910
and we're going to
split all of that up,

14
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,180
So basically everything
that we've seen,

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,250
all of those individual demos,

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,460
all fall right there,

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,020
It all comes together,

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,960
So let's go ahead and
run that little bit,

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,240
Boom, Now, we're ready
to set up our model,

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,965
Now here's what I want you to notice,

21
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:06,060
we're going to go grab our
LinearRegression from sklearn,

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,610
We're then going to
set up an instance of

23
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,420
that class and then we're going
to go ahead and call it fit,

24
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,005
We're going to pass in
our training data and for

25
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:21,585
our features and for our labels,

26
00:01:21,585 --> 00:01:25,255
So again, X is going to be
what's going to drive the value,

27
00:01:25,255 --> 00:01:28,330
y is going to be the value
that we're going to drop,

28
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,845
Now I'm openly going
to admit here that

29
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:34,720
the ending is a little bit

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,030
anticlimactic because we've
now set up this model,

31
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,720
but we don't know anything about it,

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,705
We haven't seen yet maybe how
we could predict a value,

33
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:46,030
You'll also notice that we haven't

34
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,830
yet used any of that testing data,

35
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,570
Well, the reason that we haven't used

36
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,250
any of the testing data is all the

37
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,625
we've done at this point is
we've just done our training,

38
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:59,195
All that we've done is
we've set up our model,

39
00:01:59,195 --> 00:02:05,585
Now, it's time to turn our attention
to see how well did we do?

40
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:08,430
That's where we're going to
look at in the next module,
